/*
  With http module, we need to handle routes manually.
  by checking the request.url property and using if-else conditions.

  With Express, we can define routes easily. We don't need conditional statements to handle routes.
  get(), post(), put(), delete() methods are used to define routes in Express.

  In http module, we need to work for types of requests and routes.
  In Express, we have ready-made methods to make use of request type directly.
