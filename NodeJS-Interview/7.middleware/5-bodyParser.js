What is body-parser in express?
Body-parser is a middleware used to parse the request body and populate the req.body object.
 It is used to handle the HTTP POST request in Express.js. 
 It extracts the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body.

    1. JSON body-parser: It parses the JSON data and populates the req.body object.
    2. Raw body-parser: It parses the raw data and populates the req.body object.
    3. Text body-parser: It parses the text data and populates the req.body object.
    4. URL-encoded body-parser: It parses the URL-encoded data and populates the req.body object.
