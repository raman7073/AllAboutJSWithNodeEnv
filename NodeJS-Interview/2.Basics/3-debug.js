/*
  We do not see more debgging options like
  step over, step into, step out, resume, pause, stop, restart, etc.
  Node gives a parameter called inspect-brk which can be used with node command and 
  is used to debug the code.
  node --inspect-brk filename.js
  This will open a debugger tab in the browser.
  we can see by opening chrome://inspect in the browser.

  Breakpoints are the points where the code will pause execution and from that point
  we can manually execute the code line by line.
