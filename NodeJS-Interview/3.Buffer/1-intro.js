/*
Node.Js offers a global object called 
"Buffer" to deal with binary data.
Buffer does a lot of operations automatically.
We need to know the important methods and concepts.
Binary ,decimal , hexadecimal : numeric system

Character sets are basically the collection of symbols and characters
which are internally linked to numbers.


Unicode character set has 150,000 characters roughlt.
Ascii character set has 256 characters.
utf-8 character set .
Character encoding is a fundamental concept in computing that defines
how characters (letters, numbers, symbols) are represented as binary data. 
Each character in a character set is assigned a unique numeric code, 
and this code is then translated into binary form for storage or transmission.

If you use some other character set then the encoding system might be different.
A binary encoded data in one char set might represent different char in other character set.
Ex: 01001010 in utf-8 represent "J", it might be "S" in other character set.
